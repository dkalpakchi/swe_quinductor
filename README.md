# Applying Quinductor for generating question-answer pairs in Swedish
This is the official repository for the article ["Automatically generating question-answer pairs for assessing basic reading comprehension in Swedish"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15568)

We have applied [Quinductor](https://github.com/dkalpakchi/quinductor) for generating question-answer pairs in Swedish. The QA-templates have been induced using [SweQUAD-MC dataset](https://github.com/dkalpakchi/SweQUAD-MC).
